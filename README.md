# Ingredi Search
This is just a project to follow [this](https://www.raywenderlich.com/174137/android-unit-testing-with-mockito) tutorial

I want to learn more about tests and I figure out it would be a nice idea to follow a tutorial on [Ray Wenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com/)

This is just a repository to save my progress and mistake during my learning process.


## Steps to run the app

1. Get your Food2Fork API key
2. Create a keystore.properties file with the following content (including the quotes):
```
FOOD2FORK_API_KEY="YOUR API KEY"
```

3. Place this file in the root project.
